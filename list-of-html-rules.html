          These rules below will help you writing successful HTML5 document:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li> Every HTML element is defined by an opening tag and a closing tag wrapped around their content, pair of angle brackets surround each tag.</li>
          <li>
            You have to start typing your code by &lt;DOCTYPE html>
            </li>
          <li> The difference between the opening tag and a closing tag is a single forward slash (/) for a closing tag.</li>
          <li>It' s not always necessary to put closing tag to all elements because some HTML5 elements don't need to have closing tag.</li>
          <li>You can make an empty element close itself by adding a forward slash (/) before the second angle bracket (>)</li>
          <li>Technically, you could mix uppercase and lowercase letters in HTML5. However, it's generally deemed good practice to use <b>lowercase</b> letters for element and attribute names.</li>
          <li>You can add a blank line to separate large code blocks, but don't overuse them.</li>
          <li>White space is tricky too. You can add two spaces for indentation</li>
          <li>Code comments are written between an opening angle bracket followed by an exclamation mark and two dashes and two dashes then aclosing angle bracket. They do not affect the web page on the user side, as their purpose is to only make notes for the developer</li>
