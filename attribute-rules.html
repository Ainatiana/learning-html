        <h2>
          Here are the rules about attribute that you have to follow:
        </h2>
        <section>
          <p>
            Attributes act like <b>extra</b> information tied to an HTML element. They are written within an HTML tag. For example, the <code>href</code> attribute used to define the target of a link (which uses an anchor tag): &lt;a href="https://this-website.com"&gt;this-link&lt;/a&gt; 
          </p>
          <p>
            Some HTML elements have obligatory attributes. For example, when inserting an image, you have to provide the location of the image, using the <code>src</code> attribute. &lt;img src="#" alt="Description of the image"&gt; in the <b>src="#"</b>, the "#" is the value of the attribute "src"
          </p>
        </section>
        <blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>Attributes have to be written in <b>lowercase</b>.</li>
            <li>Attribute value must have quotes.</li>
            <li>Attributes are separated with spaces.</li>
            <li>You cannot have quotes (“”) inside quotes, use (‘) instead.</li>
            <li>You have to have value inside the quotes.</li>
            <li> Id attribute identifies an element in HTML document. </li>
            <li> Once a name is used as the value of an id attribute of an HTML element, it can not be used as the value of any other element's id attribute in that document.</li>
            <li> Unlike id, name of a class can be used with multiple elements in an HTML document.</li>
            <li>Attribute names must consist of one or more characters other than the space characters.</li>
            <li>Attribute value must not contain space.</li>
            <li>It is necessary to add <b>alt</b> atribute to image because sometimes, the image for some reason cannot be displayed.</li>
            <li>If it' s possible, try not to put any space around equal signs.</li>
          </ul>
